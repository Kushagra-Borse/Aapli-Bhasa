# Aapli-Bhasa
This is programming language I have made for fun, putting some fun words and Slangs.

Remember to do this in a virtual environment. Still writing the program. It's work in progress.
In the terminal/commmand prompt just go into the directory and run
```
# Create a virtual environment 
python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment

# Windows
myenv\Scripts\activate
# macOS and Linux
source myenv/bin/activate
```


```
python shell.py
```

I have written an interpreted language in Python ðŸ˜‰. It might not be the best idea to write it in Python.
But do not worry Bhasha is coming in Cpp and Java soon.
